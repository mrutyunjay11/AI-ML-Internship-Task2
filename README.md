# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Explore the Titanic dataset to discover patterns, trends, and relationships between features and survival.

## Steps
Step 1 -> Calculate summary statistics: mean, median, standard deviation.  
Step 2 -> Create visualizations: histograms, boxplots, pairplots, heatmaps.  
Step 3 -> Analyze correlations and extract feature-level insights.  
Step 4 -> Check skewness and detect multicollinearity among features.

## Tools we used for performs it is :
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

# Dataset Which we used for do it is :
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
